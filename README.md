### Some Interesting Quant problems solved with Brute Force Monte Carlo (love it)

Included are some interesting quant problems from Optiver, Da Vinci, DRW, HRT, Goldman Sachs, Squarepoint, Millenium (more to add)

The Millenium quant challenge involved coding up a market maker from scratch. This involves implementing setting Bid & Ask prices as a MM, interacting with a Hedge fund which acts as a market maker. The MM needs to dynamically adjust bid and ask to hedge its position. Also hedge using an ETF, accounting for different volatities of each stock by adjusting the Beta for each stock. Lastly this involves implementing an arbitrage algorithm, taking advantage of any price differences between the ETF and the net asset value.
